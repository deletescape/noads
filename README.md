# noads.online Filterlists

This repository contains most of my personal blocklist projects, as well as the [compiled megalist](https://lists.noads.online/lists/compilation.txt) used by the DNS server I am running (see https://deletescape.ch/dns).

## Thanks

Thanks a lot to @DandelionSprout for the base of the script I am using to compile the lists together.
Thanks a lot as well to everyone creating the original lists I am compiling together.
